Hello ^^STUDENT_NAME^^,

We are writing to discuss your Academic English progress at IES. Your recent AE Diagnostic Test results were below the pass mark. At IES you must obtain 65% or higher to be made an offer at the University of Queensland.

We will support you as much as possible to achieve your goal of 65% in Academic English. The following is your Individual Study Plan (ISP), which your Academic English teacher will monitor over the coming weeks.

Your Individual Study Plan:

ESSENTIAL â€“ You MUST complete the following tasks:

1. ATTEND English Language Assistance (ELA) Classes: You have been allocated a specific ELA class each week. This will display on your Edval timetable. You can also find the ELA timetable on myFY and Moodle.

2. Attend IELTS classes: This will help your AE ability and your IELTS scores in case you receive a conditional offer at the end of foundation year. The IELTS class timetable is shown on AE Moodle.

3. COMPLETE AE and ELA Moodle Tasks: complete the activities on Moodle. These activities are designed to support your skill development. Your teacher will talk about these in class.

Your teacher will monitor that you are completing the tasks above.

Following the Individual Study Plan above will give you the best chance of succeeding academically. Your teacher will manage your ISP, but please feel free to speak to a student counsellor if you feel that it is necessary.

Regards,

^^TEACHER_NAME^^
